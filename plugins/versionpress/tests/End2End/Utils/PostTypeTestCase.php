 * Note that there are dependencies between tests - for example, the runUndoTrashTest() function expects
 * a state created by runTrashPostTest(). These dependencies are denoted in the actual actual test classes
 * using the @ depends annotation.
 *
 * Note2: helper test methods are called runXyzTest(), not testXyz() because otherwise PHPUnit would consider
