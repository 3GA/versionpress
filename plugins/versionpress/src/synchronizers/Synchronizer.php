 * Synchronizers synchronize entities from {@link EntityStorage storages} back to the database.
 *
 * Most storages have their complementary synchronizers so the typical relationship is 1:1 but in some
 * cases, there may be more synchronizers for a single storage. For example, both VersionPress\Synchronizers\PostsSynchronizer
 * and VersionPress\Synchronizers\TermRelationshipsSynchronizer exist for VersionPress\Storages\PostStorage.
 *
 * Synchronizers do work that is kind of opposite to the ones of storages but with one major
 * difference: while storages usually add or delete entities one by one or by small amounts,
 * synchronizers operate over all entities and completely overwrite the whole db table
 * (with the exception of untracked or ignored rows, see below). Synchronizers also sometimes
 * execute additional SQL queries to get the database to a fully working state - for example,
 * the VersionPress\Synchronizers\PostsSynchronizer counts comments and updates the `comment_count` field.
 *
 * Synchronizers are run by the {@link VersionPress\Synchronizers\SynchronizationProcess}.
