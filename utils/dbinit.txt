To quickly revert to the default database state:

1) Export the db in the desired state, e.g., right after a clean installation
     - MAKE SURE you include DROP TABLE statements
     - MAKE SURE the foreign keys check is disabled (SET foreign_key_checks = 0;)
     
2) Add this manually at the beginning of the SQL script:

-- Drop VersionPress tables and views. Don't create them here, plugin installation does that.
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `wp_vp_id`;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `wp_vp_references`;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS `wp_vp_reference_details`;
