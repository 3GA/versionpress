## Reporting bugs

Generally, there can be two kinds of issues with VersionPress:

1. You cannot get it working on a *specific site* (on your host, with a certain combination of plugins etc.). In that case please open a ticket in our [**support repo**](https://github.com/versionpress/support).
2. You indeed found a bug *in VersionPress*, or at least you're pretty sure you did.

Then, do this:

1. Search [the issues](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/issues) to see if it hasn't been reported before. Here's a [quick wiki page](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/wiki/Issues) on how we use the issues.
2. Open a new issue for the bug. Someone from the team will respond to you soon and label the issue appropriately.

What makes the bug report *amazing* for us:

- You articulate the problem clearly and provide **steps to reproduce** the problem. Reproducibility is a very important thing in every issue.
-  Screenshots or GIFs are appreciated!


## Feature ideas

Ideas are great. VersionPress needs them. There are so many difficult problems still to solve, and so many opportunities to make the project better.

:bulb: :bulb: :bulb:

The best place to start is [our Gitter room](https://gitter.im/versionpress/versionpress). You'll get some initial feedback and if the idea is worth pursuing, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/versionpress/versionpress/issues) for it.

## Contributing code

We use the standard [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/):

![GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/branching.png)

so you can submit a pull request if you fixed anything or implemented a new feature.

With that being said, we need to be honest here: VersionPress is a lot more complex than a typical WordPress plugin and people are sometimes disappointed that they cannot just clone the repo to `wp-content/plugins` and start hacking. There's quite a bit of [dev setup](./docs/Dev-Setup.md) required at the moment, there's a build step necessary etc. We're continuously improving the dev story but quick PHP hacking will probably never be how VersionPress gets developed.

If you still feel like you would like to contribute to one of the most technically ambitious projects in the WordPress space, awesome! Here are links to get you started:

- [Dev-Setup](./docs/Dev-Setup.md)
- [Testing](./docs/Testing.md)

## Improving docs

Public docs (docs.versionpress.net) are managed via the [versionpress/docs](https://github.com/versionpress/docs) repo. We'll be happy to accept Pull Requests with improvements, spelling errors etc. â€“ thank you!
